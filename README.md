# armada-dice-simulator
A command line program designed to simulate the outcome of dice in Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars Armada.

# Objective
I wrote this program as a quick project to put into practice what I learned from CSCI 455 at USC. I applied the following principles into my program:

1. Inheritance
2. Usage of Arrays, HashMaps, TreeMaps
3. Polymorphism
4. Unit Testing
5. Practice with the Java Scanner and Random class
6. Proper method descriptions
7. Representation Invariants for classes

# How to run
1. Make sure you have Java 11 JDK installed. I highly recommend https://sdkman.io/ to manage your SDKs.
2. Change directory to the repository and run `javac *.java`
3. Run `java ArmadaDiceSimulator.java`
